```

#### Action 2: Launch Posts (1-2 hours)

**LinkedIn Post** (adapt from existing social-post.md style):

```
I spent the last month building MetaSAAS — a framework where you define your business entities and get a production SaaS app automatically.

Authentication, CRUD, API, AI assistant, multi-tenancy, dark mode, kanban views, search, webhooks — all generated from entity definitions.

I validated it across 5 completely different domains (CRM, project management, clinic scheduling, inventory, gym management) without changing a single line of platform code.

Today I'm releasing early access for $149 (increases to $299).

If you build SaaS products and you're tired of spending 3 weeks on the same boilerplate every time — this is for you.

**Reddit Post** (r/SaaS or r/nextjs):

```
Title: I built a framework that generates 80% of any SaaS app from entity definitions

I got tired of rebuilding the same infrastructure for every SaaS product:
auth, CRUD, API, admin UI, dark mode, search, multi-tenancy...

So I built MetaSAAS — define your entities (fields, relationships, workflows) and the platform generates everything else automatically.

What it handles:
- PostgreSQL schemas + migrations (auto-generated)
- REST API with Zod validation, RBAC, rate limiting
- Dynamic UI: list views, kanban boards, calendar grids
- AI command bar (natural language → actions)
- Multi-tenant by default
- Webhooks with retry + circuit breaker
- Dark mode that actually works everywhere
- 348 tests, Docker deployment

I tested it by building 5 completely different apps (CRM, clinic scheduler,
gym management, inventory, project tracker) — zero platform changes needed.

Stack: TypeScript, Next.js 15, React 19, Fastify, Drizzle ORM, Supabase Auth, Tailwind 4.

Early access: $149. Happy to answer questions about the architecture.
```

## Stream B: Security Questionnaire Service

### Why This Is the Fastest Money

From PRODUCT-OPPORTUNITIES analysis:
- **#1 rated painkiller** across 44 problems
- CTO has a 200-question questionnaire due in 5 days
- A $100K+ deal depends on it
- They'd pay $500-$1,000 to make it go away
- Zero technical barriers to start (you + a spreadsheet)
- Every engagement builds your knowledge base
- MetaSAAS engineering background = unfair advantage

### Who Buys This

**Target**: CTOs/founders at B2B SaaS companies (Series A-B, 15-80 employees)

**Trigger**: They just landed an enterprise prospect who sent a security questionnaire. Deal is $50K-$500K. Deadline is 5-10 days.

**Where to find them**:
- LinkedIn: "CTO" OR "Co-founder" at recently funded B2B SaaS companies
- Twitter/X: Search "security questionnaire" OR "SOC 2" OR "vendor assessment"
- YC companies: Post-seed, going upmarket for the first time
- Crunchbase: Filter Series A/B, B2B SaaS, 15-80 employees

### Today's Actions (Feb 26)

#### Action 1: Send 10 Cold Messages on LinkedIn (1 hour)

**Finding targets**:
1. Open LinkedIn Sales Navigator (or regular search)
2. Search: `CTO OR "Co-founder" OR "VP Engineering"`
3. Filter: Company size 11-50, Industry: Technology/SaaS
4. Look for companies that recently raised (Series A/B), are B2B, and sell to enterprise

**Message template** (proven from PRODUCT-OPPORTUNITIES):

```
Hey [Name] — quick question: how many security questionnaires did your team
fill out in the last 6 months?

I've been talking to CTOs who spend 1-2 days each on these, every enterprise
deal. Same questions, different formats.

I'm testing a service where you hand me the questionnaire and get it back
completed in 48 hours — $750 per questionnaire.

Worth a 10-min chat?
```

**Variations for different contexts**:

If they recently raised:
```
Hey [Name] — congrats on the [Series A/B]. Now that [Company] is going
upmarket, are you getting hit with enterprise security questionnaires yet?

Most CTOs I talk to lose 1-2 days on each one. Same 200 questions, different
Excel formats, every deal.

I complete them in 48 hours so you don't have to. Worth a quick chat?
```

If they mention compliance publicly:
```
[Name] — saw your post about [compliance topic]. Real pain.

Quick offer: I complete security questionnaires for B2B SaaS companies.
You send the spreadsheet, I send it back done in 48 hours. $750.

Interested?
```

#### Action 2: Post on Twitter/X (15 min)

```
If you're a CTO filling out a 200-question security questionnaire
right now instead of building product...

I'll do it for you. $750. 48-hour turnaround.

DM me the spreadsheet.

(Yes, I'm serious. I've built enterprise security infrastructure
and I know these questions cold.)
```

#### Action 3: Search Twitter/Reddit for Active Pain (30 min)

Search terms on Twitter:
- "security questionnaire"
- "SOC 2 questionnaire"
- "vendor assessment"
- "filling out security"
- "enterprise compliance"
- "security review" + frustrated language

Reply to people actively complaining:
```
I literally do this as a service — send me the questionnaire,
get it back completed in 48 hours. DM me if interested.
```

### End of Week Decision

**If security questionnaire gets pull**:
- People respond, want to pay, send questionnaires
- Action: Scale to 5-8/week, raise price to $1,000
- Start building answer knowledge base
- This becomes the primary business

**If framework gets pull**:
- Sales come in, people ask questions, community forms
- Action: Build missing modules (email, storage, billing)
- Launch on Product Hunt
- Consider subscription model ($29/mo for updates)

**If neither gets pull**:
- Revisit messaging (are we reaching the right people?)
- Try different channels (Upwork for service, different subreddits)
- Adjust pricing (try $49 for framework to test)
- Talk to 10 more people before changing strategy

## Objection Handling

### Framework Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "I can build this myself" | "You can. It'll take 3-4 weeks. MetaSAAS saves that time for $149. Worth it if you value your time at $50/hr." |
| "Why not use [Supabase/Firebase/etc]?" | "Those give you auth + database. MetaSAAS gives you the full app — UI, AI, workflows, multi-tenancy, dark mode. It's built ON Supabase, not competing with it." |
| "Is it maintained?" | "Actively developed, 348 tests, 9 phases shipped in February alone. You're buying in early." |
| "What if I need custom features?" | "Layer 3: hooks and custom actions. Full TypeScript, full access. The platform doesn't box you in." |

### Questionnaire Service Objections

| Objection | Response |
|-----------|----------|
| "How do you know our security posture?" | "I'll need a 30-min intake call. I'll research your stack, docs, and policies. For anything I can't verify, I flag it for your review rather than guess." |
| "$750 seems expensive" | "How much does your CTO's time cost? At $200/hr, 2 days = $3,200. I'm saving you $2,450 and 2 days of your CTO's focus." |
| "We need this to be accurate" | "I flag every answer I'm less than 90% confident on. You review 20% instead of writing 100%. And I sign an NDA before we start." |
| "Can you do SOC 2 prep too?" | "Let's start with the questionnaire. If you like the work, we can talk about broader compliance support." |

## Assets Needed

### Already Have
- [x] Dashboard screenshots (light + dark mode)
- [x] 5 working domain examples
- [x] Social post template (Feb 25)
- [x] Cold outreach templates
- [x] Technical architecture documentation

### Need to Create
- [ ] Gumroad/Lemonsqueezy product listing
- [ ] 1-page landing site (or Gumroad product page suffices for week 1)
- [ ] Demo video (5 min, can do day 4-5)
- [ ] Dev.to article (can do day 2-3)

### Can Wait
- [ ] Custom landing page in the web app (do this after first sale validates demand)
- [ ] Product Hunt launch (do this after messaging is tested on Reddit)
- [ ] Email list / newsletter (do this after 10+ interested people)

---

## The Mental Model

```
Week 1 goal is NOT to build a business.

Week 1 goal is to LEARN:
- Do developers actually pay for SaaS boilerplates? (Stream A)
- Do CTOs actually pay to offload questionnaires? (Stream B)
- Which channel gets the most response?
- What language resonates?
- What objections come up?

Revenue is the validation signal.
If people pay, the problem is real.
If they don't, adjust before building more.
```
